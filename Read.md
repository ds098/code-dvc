# DVC 
* Data Version Control, or DVC, is a data and ML experiment management tool that takes advantage of the existing engineering toolset that you're already familiar with (Git, CI/CD, etc.).
* DVC aims to replace spreadsheet and document sharing tools (such as Excel or Google Docs) which are being used frequently as both knowledge repositories and team ledgers. DVC also replaces both ad-hoc scripts to track, move, and deploy different model versions; as well as ad-hoc data file suffixes and prefixes.

## Quick Start 

1. ### Create a new branch for an existing repository and push files 
*  In config.json file mention the name of the branch, name of the repository, path of the file you want to push.
* In path the weight file should be in a zip folder with name zip.zip .
* Then readme.md and readme.json file should be there in the path. Then,
```python
python script.py
wanna create a repo, push to an existing repo, pull a repo. Input create/push/pull
push
wanna push/update master branch or feature_branch. Input master/feature
feature_branch
Provide the folderid for gdrive
1-vpngyUEgzvlawITcTmQOTYCkUKqtIbC 
``` 
(files would be pushed in the respective gdrive and the reference would be created in the git repository)
